# Filter Search

This extension adds capability to filter lines in a file to a seperate window. We can then click on the filtered line to switch back to the original line. Filtered lines are saved across files in a session.

## Features

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

![Basic Feature](images/BasicFunc.gif)

<!-- > Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->

## Extension Settings: TBD

<!-- Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something -->
